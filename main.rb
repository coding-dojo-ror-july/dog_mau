# Assignment: Dog
# Create a file mammal.rb.
# In this file, create a Mammal Class.
# A mammal should have a default health attribute with value of 150.
# Also add a method called display_health, which when invoked, prints the health of the Mammal.

# In a separate file (dog.rb) create a class called Dog that inherits from the Mammal class and do the following:
# Default health of 150 (inherited)
# A method called pet, which when invoked, increases the health by 5
# A method called walk, which when invoked, decreases the health by 1
# A method called run, which when invoked, decreases the health by 10
# A method called display_health (inherited)
# Have an instance of the Dog class walk 3 times, run twice, pet once and then display its health
